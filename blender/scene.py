"""Building a Divinity II character in Blender.

This module knows Blender. It does not know how a NIF file is laid out --
`divinity2` does that. It receives blocks the reader produced and turns them
into objects, an armature and materials.

The one rule that decides whether a character arrives whole: every `NiTriShape`
keeps its own object and its own transform. Collapsing the shapes of a
character into a single mesh loses the transforms and the character arrives as
a heap.

#: from the stream `NiD3DShaderDeclaration::PackEntry` binds as
#: `SHADERPARAM_NI_BINORMAL` -- the first block after the normals, which
#: `nif.xml` names `Tangents` -- and the Developer's Cut makes it a float4 whose
#: w is `DIV2 Floats` (+1 where the shape has none): `T = cross(N, B) * w`,
#: "should be -1 when mirrored". The stored tangent is never read.
#: (docs/sources.md, "Binormal and sign".)
#:
#: UV maps because FBX carries nothing else per corner exactly: Blender's
#: writer drops generic attributes and colours are one channel already taken.
#: Every shape gets both, zero where it stores no binormal, so they are always
#: the last two channels on the far side.
