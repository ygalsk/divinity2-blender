"""Clips as Blender actions.

A pose in Blender is expressed against the bone's rest position, not against
the parent. The clip gives the bone's local transform relative to its parent,
so each sample has to be taken back into rest space:

    matrix_basis = rest_local⁻¹ @ local_from_clip

Skipping that step produces an armature that moves -- so every count agrees --
but whose bones sit wherever the rest pose happened to differ, which reads as
a broken rig rather than a wrong conversion.
