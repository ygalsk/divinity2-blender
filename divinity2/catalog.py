"""Finding an asset by name.

A modder knows the name of the thing they want -- `goblin`, `damian`,
`chest`, `barrel` -- not which of four thousand files holds it. The catalog is
the index that turns one into the other, built by walking the install once.

The install lays its models out by kind, one folder each, and each folder uses
one extension:

| folder | extension | what is in it |
|---|---|---|
| `Characters/Templates` | `.cat` | a whole character, skeleton and clips |
| `Scenery` | `.item` | walls, doors, trees, furniture |
| `Items` | `.item` | weapons, armour, loot |
| `Effects` | `.item` | spell and particle effects |
| `FlyingFortresses` | `.item` | the flying fortresses, skinned |
| `CompiledAssets` | a folder | a compiled prop, one `LODGroup` per model |

That is every model file the game ships. `Characters/<family>/*.nif` is not
listed: those are the parts a `.cat` already bundles, and a skeleton, which
`divinity2.rig` finds on its own.
