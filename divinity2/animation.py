"""Clips.

A Divinity II clip does not store a key per frame. It stores the control
points of a cubic B-spline, quantised to 16-bit integers, and the game
evaluates the curve as it plays. This is why a keyframe importer reads such a
clip and finds nothing: there are no keyframes in it to find.

`nifgen` already undoes the quantisation -- `get_translations`,
`get_rotations`, `get_scales` hand back the control points as floats. What is
left is evaluating the curve through them, which is what this module does.

A track whose handle reads `NO_HANDLE` is not animated at all; the
interpolator's own static transform is the value for the whole clip.

    in `FindCorrespondingMorphFrame` and `VerifyMatchingMorphKeys`: a
    `morph: L_Foot_Down` on a walk and the same label on a run mark the frames
    that must be lined up when one blends into the other. It is a blend
    alignment point, and only incidentally the frame a foot lands on.

    `eq=` and `ue=` are Divinity's, and they drive equipment:
    `eq=handR:2H_Sword_Alguard` puts an item in a slot, `ue=weaponSlotBack`
    takes it out again. The slot resolves to a bone through the engine's own
    table -- see `divinity2/engine.py`. `s=Footstep_Walk` plays a sound, and a
    bare `v=-5` ramps a value as a body falls.
