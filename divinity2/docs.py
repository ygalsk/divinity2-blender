"""The game's documents, as the unpack hands them over.

Most of this game's `.xml` files are not text: they are a tree with every name
replaced by a 32-bit hash, packed into a NIF container. `vendor/dv2lib` reads
them and names them -- the one place a name is ever recovered, taken from
dv2mod -- and writes each one as plain JSON under `docs/<archive path>.json`
when the game is unpacked (the preferences' button, or
`python -m dv2lib unpack <folder>`).

This reads that JSON back. A tree is `{"name", "attrs", "text"?, "children"?}`,
an unrecovered name arrives as `#hhhhhhhh`, and **the children are already in
the engine's order** -- `xml::dom::CStreamableNode::LoadBinary` fills the last
child slot first, and the unpack undoes that once, for everything.

A document is found by the path the add-on would have opened, in the folders
`use` was given or `DV2_DOCS` lists. The add-on needs no name table and no
parser of its own.
