"""The ground of a region, and the textures that are not in the model.

A region's terrain is inside its `StaticMeshes.nif`, under a node called
`[--WorldProcessedTerrain--]`, as one `NiLODNode` per patch. Three things
about it are unlike every other mesh in the game.

**Its levels of detail are streamed, not stored.** Each patch's `NiLODNode`
holds one level inline and an empty stub for every other one, and the geometry
those stubs are waiting for is in `Meshes/Terrain/Terrain_Patch_<i>/<n>.nif`.
`AssetDataDescriptors.xml` is the manifest that says which file fills which
stub -- see `levels` and `graft`. Without it the ground arrives at whatever
level the region happened to ship inline: Banditcamp at 9,992 vertices where
the game draws 36,883, and RiverTown_FF's flying islands as 24-vertex plates.
A region with no manifest is unaffected; `divinity2.lod` still picks the
finest level that actually holds geometry.

**It carries no `NiTexturingProperty`.** A terrain shape resolves only a
`NiMaterialProperty`, so a reader that asks the model what to draw gets
nothing and the ground arrives white.

**Its material is splatted, and `Terrain.xml` holds the whole recipe.**

```
<Terrain splatdistance="116" splatblenddistance="20">
  <TerrainPatch index="6">
    <AlphaHeap>
      <AlphaMap path="TerrainTextures\\AlphaMaps\\6_6_AlphaMap_1.tga">
        <Layers><ID layerID="6" MaskIndex="2" AlphaMapIndex="1"/> ... </Layers>
    <MegaTexture path="TerrainTextures\\MegaTexture_6.dds"/>
  <Textures>
    <Texture path="BV2_Moss_A.dds" path_NM="..." TextureTiling="50" ID="6"/>
```

One `Texture` per `ID` gives the layer's picture and how often it tiles across
the patch. One channel of one alpha map -- `MaskIndex` 0 to 3 is red, green,
blue, alpha -- gives that layer's weight. The `MegaTexture` is the same ground
baked flat for distance; the game fades to it past `splatdistance`.

Two extensions lie in this chain and both were measured, not assumed: a
`MegaTexture` named `.dds` is a NIF like every other texture in this game, and
an `AlphaMap` named `.tga` is a `.dds` on disk, which is also a NIF.
`Terrain.xml` itself is Larian's binary XML, read through dv2mod -- see
`divinity2.docs`.
