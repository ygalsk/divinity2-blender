"""Opening a Divinity II NIF file.

The format itself is not described here. It is described in `nif.xml`, the
NifTools project's format specification, and read by `nifgen`, the Python
reader generated from it. `nif.xml` carries Divinity 2 as a version of its
own: NIF 20.3.0.9 with user version 0x20000 or 0x30000, extensions `nft`,
`item` and `cat`.

So this module does one thing: it puts the vendored reader on the path and
opens the file. If a block is read wrongly, the fix belongs in `nif.xml`
upstream, not here.
