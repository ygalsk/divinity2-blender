"""A whole region: what stands in it, who walks it, and what lights it.

A region is a folder under `World/`, and what it holds is spread over three
places. The ground and the built geometry are NIFs beside it; the props, the
lights and the trees are binary XML beside those; the characters, the items
and the triggers live with the episode, not with the region, and name their
region in an attribute. **The attribute places them, not the folder**:
Banditcamp's humans are in `Episodes/Episode_1_Extended/Characters/
BanditCamp_characterfile.xml`, outside `Regions/Banditcamp`, and a reader that
only looked there found 47 of the 99 characters and 169 of the 199 items. The
engine loads that file because `Characters/gamestats_global_characters.xml`
includes it, beside the region's own `Regions/<r>/Characters/
gamestats_characters.xml`; every character and item file Banditcamp's reads
touch is included by one of the two. Install-wide one file is in a folder and
in no include list, `Regions/BrokenValley_2/Items/
bv_mindread_2_cellar_itemfile.xml` -- measured 2026-09-16 -- so a reader of
BrokenValley_2 should follow the includes instead of the folders.

| what | file | what names its model |
|---|---|---|
| scenery | `World/<r>/<sub>/scenery.xml` | `rpgstats_sceneryprototypes.xml` |
| characters | `Episodes/<e>/**/Characters/*.xml` | `rpgstats_characterprototypes_visual.xml` |
| items | `Episodes/<e>/**/Items/*.xml` | `rpgstats_itemprototypes.xml` -> `..._itemvisualprototypes.xml` |
| triggers | `Episodes/<e>/Triggers/*.xml` | nothing: a trigger is a volume |
| lights | `World/<r>/<sub>/Lights/<time>/lights.xml` | nothing |
| trees | `World/<r>/<sub>/trees.xml` | `forest-settings.xml`, and see below |
| vegetation | `World/<r>/<sub>/Vegetation.nif` | itself |

**Every placement is stored the same way**: an `NiPoint3` child for the
position and an `NiMatrix3` child for the basis, in that order, and both in
metres. The engine's own readers say so --
`CRpgStats_V2_Scenery::LoadXML`, `CRpgStats_V2_Character::LoadXML`,
`CRpgStats_V2_Item::LoadXML` and `CGameLogic_Tree::LoadXML` all take
`children[0]` as the position and `children[1]` as the orientation. The
binary stream stores children in reverse, and dv2mod undoes that once, for
everything; see `divinity2.docs`.

**A trigger is a prism or a point.** `Trigger_area` holds a `PolyArea` with
`Top` and `Bottom` and a ring of `AreaPoint`s at the bottom height, so the
volume is that polygon extruded upward. `Trigger_Point`, `Trigger_Orientation`
and their named cousins hold a single position, with a basis when the thing
has a facing. The `Type` number is not decoded here: the child element is its
own label and needs no table.

**A tree has no mesh.** `model="BoxWood"` names a `CTreeModel` in
`forest-settings.xml`, whose `model` is a SpeedTree `.spt` -- a procedural
definition, not geometry. The whole SpeedTree runtime is linked into the game
(`CSpeedTreeRT::LoadTree`, `CTreeModel::SetupBranchGeometry`) and grows the
tree at load. So a tree arrives as a marker with its name, its position and
its size, and the size is exact:
`CGameLogic_Tree::PreparePhysicsData` computes it as
`rescaled.y * CTreeModel.size`, where `CGameLogic_Tree::UpdateInstanceData`
sets `rescaled.y = (1 - v) + instance.y * v * 2` for `v = treesizevariation`.
`instance.x` is the tree's rotation and `instance.z` its colour variation,
both fed to the SpeedTree shader; neither is converted here.

**Vegetation is scattered by the engine, not stored.** `Vegetation.nif` is the
region's library of grass and undergrowth meshes, one `NiNode` per source
file, and `vegetationtemplatedata.xml` names them again with their textures.
Where each blade stands is generated at load from a seed and a per-cell mask
(`Vegetation/VM_<x>_<y>.tga`, the names
`CVegetationGridManager::GenerateVegetationGridEntryDescriptors` scans for).
That generator is not reproduced here, so the library comes in unplaced.
