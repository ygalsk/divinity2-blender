"""Binding geometry to one armature.

A skinned shape stores its vertices in its own node's space, and one matrix
per bone to get them out of it: `NiSkinData.bone_list[i].skin_transform`.
Together with where that bone stands in the skeleton, that is the whole
deformation:

    v = Σᵢ wᵢ · Wᵢ · Bᵢ · v

`Bᵢ` is the bone's `skin_transform` and `Wᵢ` is the bone's world transform in
the skeleton file. Nothing else takes part.

In particular `NiSkinData.skin_transform` does not. It is the inverse of the
shape node's own world transform -- measured on `FroblinBoss_Armor_A`, the
node sits at (-393.0, -260.9, 79.2) and the skin transform undoes exactly
that -- so it says where the geometry came from, not where it goes. Folding
it into the deformation moves the armour half a metre off the body and moves
a shape that happens to sit at the origin not at all, which is why a
character can look right and its armour wrong at the same time.

So the skeleton file is the rest pose, all of it, for every mesh file of a
character. There is no second pose to reconcile and no reason for a second
armature.

Where a shape mentions a bone the armature does not have, its weight is
dropped and the rest renormalised, so the shape still arrives whole.
