"""Walking a Divinity II scene graph the way the engine does.

Everything drawable in this game hangs off a tree of `NiAVObject`s, and what
reaches the screen is decided on the way down, not at the leaf. Four things
accumulate:

**The transform.** Each node's translation, rotation and uniform scale
multiply onto the parent's.

**The property state.** Gamebryo attaches render state to a node, not to a
shape, and a shape inherits it from the nearest ancestor that carries one.
The engine builds that state in `NiAVObject::UpdateProperties`, which walks
*upward* through the parents, and merges each node's own list in
`NiAVObject::PushLocalProperties`: it copies the inherited state and writes
each local property into the one slot its type owns. **The nearest node with
a property of that type wins.** `NiPropertyState` has one slot each for
alpha, material, stencil, specular, shade, dither and fog.

In Divinity II this changes nothing for texturing, material, alpha, specular
or stencil -- measured over 795 drawn shapes, every one of those sits on the
shape itself. It is `NiVertexColorProperty` (79% inherited) and
`NiZBufferProperty` (97%) that live above. The walk does it properly anyway,
because doing it at the leaf is right by accident.

**Whether it is drawn.** Bit 0 of any node's flags is `APP_CULLED`, and the
engine is unambiguous: `NiAVObject::GetAppCulled` is
`return this->m_uFlags & 1;`. A culled node takes its whole subtree with it.

**Which child of a chooser.** `NiLODNode` is a `NiSwitchNode`, and one child
is active at a time. See `divinity2.lod`.

**Whether it has a texture.** A shape with no `NiTexturingProperty` is not
drawn, and this is not a guess about art: `CShadingTools::SetupStandardData`
tests `NiAVObject::GetProperty(8)` -- the texturing slot -- and where it is
missing it does `m_uFlags |= 1`, which is `APP_CULLED`. It does the same for
a shape whose model data carries no texture coordinates
(`m_usDataFlags & 0x3f`). Everything the game shades forward passes through
it: `CRegionVisual::ParseRegionNode`, `CStaticAssetDataManager` and the
terrain manager all call `SetupForwardShadingMaterial`, which calls it.

**The ground is the exception**, and the engine makes it too: a terrain patch
is textured from `Terrain.xml`, not from the model, and
`CTerrainPatchLOD::RecreateForwardShadingPropertyState` builds its property
state afterwards. So a shape inside a `Terrain_Patch_<n>` keeps its place
whatever the model says, and `divinity2.terrain.patch_of` is the same test
the rest of the add-on already uses for it.

In Banditcamp the rule catches eight shapes: the six effect proxies, which
the marker rule already caught, and the two untextured halves of
**`BC_ShadowHide_01`** -- the hundred-and-seventeen-metre block that stood in
the middle of every screenshot for a week. The other two shapes under that
same node do carry a texture, and they stay: one of them is the temple
floor.

**The markers the region reader looks for.** `CRegionVisual::ParseRegionNode`
reads a node's `NiStringExtraData` and turns some of them into something that
is not geometry at all: `effectproxy = yes` becomes a particle system loaded
from `Win32\\Effects\\` and the box that marked it is never drawn, `glowproxy`
becomes a `CGlowEffect`, and a node whose name starts `PhysicsPROXY_` is a
collision hull. Those markers are inherited by everything beneath, so the walk
carries them down with the rest.

The game uses six node types and no more: `NiNode`, `NiTriShape`,
`NiParticleSystem`, `NiLODNode`, `NiBillboardNode`, `NiSortAdjustNode`.
