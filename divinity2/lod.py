"""Levels of detail.

A character ships every level of detail in the same file -- `Froblin_HI`,
`Froblin_MED`, `Froblin_LOW` -- and importing all three stacks three bodies in
the same place.

The game states a level of detail in two unrelated ways, and both have to be
read. A character uses a string in each shape's `UserPropBuffer`. Everything
built into a region uses `NiLODNode`, the standard Gamebryo container, whose
`NiRangeLODData` gives one camera-distance range per child.

Which is which is written down, so it need not be guessed from the name. Every
shape carries a `UserPropBuffer` string, and in it:

    NiBoneLOD#Skin#0#0#

    LODDistance = 0.0

The number after `Skin#` is the level, 0 being the one the game shows up close.
A shape with no such string is not part of a LOD group and is always shown.
