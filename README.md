# Divinity II for Blender

A Blender add-on that imports the models and whole regions of
**Divinity II: Developer's Cut** (Larian Studios, 2009).

- **Every model the game ships**: 324 characters with their skeletons,
  textures and animations, 1,695 scenery pieces, 886 items, 378 effects,
  295 props and 21 flying fortresses.
- **Whole regions**: the ground, the scenery, items, characters, lights, trees,
  triggers, and the grass the game scatters at load time. 19 regions,
  122 sub-regions.
- **In metres, textured**: diffuse and normal maps, transparency, vertex
  colours, and animation clips as actions with their events as markers.

## What you need

- Blender 5.2 or newer
- Your own copy of Divinity II: Developer's Cut. The original Ego Draconis
  release is not supported.
- About 7 GB of free disk space

## Install

1. Download `divinity2-<version>.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/ygalsk/divinity2-blender/releases).
2. In Blender: *Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions*, open the drop-down menu
   in the top right, choose *Install from Disk…* and pick the zip.
3. Still in Preferences, expand the **Divinity II** add-on, set **Game folder**
   to an empty folder and press **Unpack the game**. This takes about a
   minute and happens once.

A Steam copy of the game is found automatically. For any other install, first
set **Divinity II install** to the folder that contains `Data` and `bin`.

## Use

**One model:** *File > Import > Divinity II asset*, or the **Divinity II** tab
in the 3D view's sidebar (press `N`). Type part of a name, such as `goblin`,
`damian`, `chest` or `P_Doors`, pick the model and press OK.

**A whole region:** *File > Import > Divinity II region*. Choose the region, the
sub-region and what to bring in. Grass is off by default because it adds
thousands of objects. Banditcamp with everything takes about 50 seconds.

To get a model out again, use Blender's own glTF or FBX export.

The full guide is [docs/using-it.md](docs/using-it.md).

## Known limitations

- Effects that are pure particle emitters import as nothing.
- Equipment changes that animations trigger are not simulated.
- Trees are placeholder markers of the right size: the game grows them from
  SpeedTree definitions, and no mesh for them exists on disk.
- Walk cycles tread in place. That is how the game stores them: the engine
  moves the character, not the clip.
